Adducin 3 ({ADD}3) is a cytoskeletal protein associated with chemoresistance but its role in glioblastoma has not been investigated. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Using an in vitro model of glioblastoma cells with acquired temozolomide resistance (D54-{MG}-R), the expressions of {ADD}3 and cancer stem cell markers were compared to those in temozolomide-sensitive glioblastoma cells (D54-{MG}-S). Immunofluorescence staining was used to investigate the expression patterns of {ADD}3 and cancer stem cell markers in temozolomide resistance and neurospheres of glioblastoma. {RESULTS}: Chemoresistant cells were found to have up-regulation of {ADD}3 and {CD}133 expression. A sub-population of D54-{MG}-R cells and glioma neurospheres exhibited coexpression of {ADD}3 with {CD}133. {CONCLUSION}: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a possible link between cytoskeletal protein expression, cancer stem cell phenotype and temozolomide resistance in human glioblastoma. This report lays the foundation for further investigation for {ADD}3 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in temozolomide-resistant glioma cells.},

There is a lack of ideal prediction models for post-operative glioma patient progression and drug sensitivity. We aimed to develop a prognostic model of parthanatos {mRNA} biomarkers for glioma outcomes. A total of 11 parthanatos genes were obtained from {ParthanatosCluster} database. {ConsensusClusterPlus} and R "Limma" package were used to cluster The Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA})-glioma cohort and analyze the differential {mRNAs}. Univariate Cox regression analysis, random survival forest model, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ({LASSO}) regression analysis were used to determine the nine {ParthanatosScore} prognostic genes combination. {ParthanatosScore} was verified by 656 patients and 979 patients in {TCGA} and {CGCA}-{LGG}/{GBM} datasets. Differences in genomic mutations, tumor microenvironments, and functional pathways were assessed. Drug response prediction was performed using {pRRophetic}. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was analyzed. Finally, {COL}8A1 was selected to evaluate its potential biological function and drug sensitivity of temozolomide and {AZD}3759 in glioma cells. {ParthanatosScore} obtained a combination of nine glioma prognostic genes, including {CD}58, H19, {TNFAIP}6, {FTLP}3, {TNFRSF}11B, {SFRP}2, {LOXL}1, {COL}8A1, and {FABP}5P7. In the {TCGA}-{LGG}/{GBM} dataset, glioma prognosis was poor in high {ParthanatosScore}. Low-score glioma patients were sensitive to {AZD}3759\_1915, {AZD}5582\_1617, {AZD}8186\_1918, Dasatinib\_1079, and Temozolomide\_1375, while high-score patients were less sensitive to these drugs. Compared with {HA} cells, {COL}8A1 was significantly over-expressed in {LN}229 and U251 cells. Silencing {COL}8A1 inhibited the malignant characterization of {LN}229 and U251 cells. Temozolomide and {AZD}3759 also promoted parthanatos gene expression in glioma cells. Temozolomide and {AZD}3759 inhibited {COL}8A1 expression and cell viability and promoted apoptosis in glioma cells and {PGM} cells. {ParthanatosScore} can accurately predict clinical prognosis and drug sensitivity after glioma surgery.

Although temozolomide ({TMZ}) has been applied for malignant gliomas as a canonical chemotherapy, the treatment of glioma still remains limited due to frequently developed resistance to {TMZ}. Therefore, promising strategies that sensitize glioma cells to temozolomide are overwhelming to develop. Here we found that the expression of dihydrofolate reductase ({DHFR}) and thymidylate synthetase ({TYMS}), which played an essential role in folate metabolism and several types of tumors, were up-regulated in both human glioma tissues and cell lines, and overexpression of {DHFR}/{TYMS} promoted the proliferation of glioma cells. Notably, inhibition of {DHFR}/{TYMS} by pemetrexed exhibited synergistic anti-glioma activity with {TMZ} in both cell lines and U251 xenografts, which suggested potential combined chemotherapy for glioma. Mechanistically, the synergistic effect of inhibition of {DHFR}/{TYMS} with {TMZ} was due to activated {AMPK} and subsequently suppressed {mTOR} signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings identify an uncharacterized role of {DHFR}/{TYMS} in glioma growth and {TMZ} sensitivity mediated by {AMPK}-{mTOR} signal pathway, and provide a prospective approach for improving the anti-tumor activity of {TMZ} in glioma.},

In pediatric patients, {GBM} exhibits genetic variations distinct from those identified in the adult {GBM} phenotype. This tumor exhibits complex genetic changes leading to malignant progression and resistance to standard therapies including radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment. The {GDF}15 gene codes for a growth factor whose expression is altered in the presence of inflammations and malignancies. {GDF}15 is associated with a poor prognosis and with radio- and chemoresistance in a variety of tumors. The aim of this study was to compare the response to {GDF}15 knockdown in adult (U343) and pediatric ({KNS}42) {GBM} cell line models. {METHODS}: The expression of the {GDF}15 gene was investigated by {qRT}-{PCR} and overexpression was identified in both {GBM} cell lines. The {KNS}42 and U343 cell lines were submitted to lentiviral transduction with {shRNA} of {GDF}15 and validated at the protein level. To understand the difference between cell lines, {RNAseq} was performed after {GDF}15 knockdown. {RESULTS}: The data obtained demonstrated that the pathways were differentially expressed in adult {GBM} and pediatric {GBM} cell lines. This was confirmed by functional assays perfomed after independent treatments (radiotherapy and {TMZ}). {CONCLUSION}: These results demonstrated that {GBM} cell lines had distinct responses to {GDF}15 knockdown, a fact that can be explained by the different molecular profile of pediatric and adult {GBM}.},

Activation of the enhancer correlates with increased {MGMT} expression, a major known mechanism for {TMZ} resistance. We show that forced activation of the enhancer in cell lines with low {MGMT} expression results in elevated {MGMT} expression. Deletion of this enhancer in cell lines with high {MGMT} expression leads to a dramatic reduction of {MGMT} and a lesser extent of Ki67 expression, increased {TMZ} sensitivity, and impaired proliferation.

Therefore, there is a need to find alternative drug targets to reduce treatment resistance based on tumor dependencies. A possibility is to target simultaneously two proteins from different {DNA}-damage repair pathways to facilitate tumor cell death. Therefore, we tested whether targeting the human chromatin kinase {VRK}1 by {RNA} interference can identify this protein as a novel molecular target to reduce the dependence on temozolomide in combination with olaparib, based on synthetic lethality. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Depletion of {VRK}1, an enzyme that regulates chromatin dynamic reorganization and facilitates resistance to {DNA} damage, was performed in glioblastoma cells treated with temozolomide, an alkylating agent used for {GBM} treatment; and olaparib, an inhibitor of {PARP}-1, used as sensitizer. Two genetically different human glioblastoma cell lines, {LN}-18 and {LN}-229, were used for these experiments. The effect on the {DNA}-damage response was followed by determination of sequential steps in this process: H4K16ac, γH2AX, H4K20me2, and 53BP1. {RESULTS}: The combination of temozolomide and olaparib increased {DNA} damage detected by labeling free {DNA} ends, and chromatin relaxation detected by H4K16ac. The combination of both drugs, at lower doses, resulted in an increase in the {DNA} damage response detected by the formation of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci. {VRK}1 depletion did not prevent the generation of {DNA} damage in {TUNEL} assays, but significantly impaired the {DNA} damage response induced by temozolomide and olaparib, and mediated by γH2AX, H4K20me2, and 53BP1. The combination of these drugs in {VRK}1 depleted cells resulted in an increase of glioblastoma cell death detected by annexin V and the processing of {PARP}-1 and caspase-3. {CONCLUSION}: Depletion of the chromatin kinase {VRK}1 promotes tumor cell death at lower doses of a combination of temozolomide and olaparib treatments, and can be a novel alternative target for therapies based on synthetic lethality.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults and a highly lethal malignancy with a median survival of about 15 months. The aggressive invasion of the surrounding normal brain makes complete surgical resection impossible, increases the resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, and assures tumor recurrence. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop innovative therapeutics to target the invasive tumor cells for improved treatment outcomes of this disease. Expression of {TROY} ({TNFRSF}19), a member of the tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}) receptor family, increases with increasing glial tumor grade and inversely correlates with patient survival. Increased expression of {TROY} stimulates glioblastoma cell invasion in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to temozolomide and radiation therapy. Conversely, silencing {TROY} expression inhibits glioblastoma cell invasion, increases temozolomide sensitivity, and prolongs survival in an intracranial xenograft model. Here, a novel complex is identified between {TROY} and {EGFR}, which is mediated predominantly by the cysteine-rich {CRD}3 domain of {TROY}. Glioblastoma tumors with elevated {TROY} expression have a statistically positive correlation with increased {EGFR} expression. {TROY} expression significantly increases the capacity of {EGF} to stimulate glioblastoma cell invasion, whereas depletion of {TROY} expression blocks {EGF} stimulation of glioblastoma cell invasion. Mechanistically, {TROY} expression modulates {EGFR} signaling by facilitating {EGFR} activation and delaying {EGFR} receptor internalization. Moreover, the association of {EGFR} with {TROY} increases {TROY}-induced {NF}-κB activation. These findings substantiate a critical role for the {TROY}–{EGFR} complex in regulation of glioblastoma cell invasion.
            Implications: The {TROY}–{EGFR} signaling complex emerges as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit glioblastoma cell invasion. Mol Cancer Res; 16(2); 322–32. ©2017 {AACR}.},

We describe here a case of a 48-yr-old male patient with three-nodular {GBM}. To address the question of intratumoral molecular heterogeneity, a comparative analysis of gene expression was performed by using multiple samples collected from different tumor sites with the aid of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). Sixteen {GBM} biosamples from parietal, temporal, and temporo-polar localizations were collected from primary, recurrent, and second recurrent tumors and were obtained and investigated by {RNA} sequencing. Our investigations revealed that biosamples derived from different tumor sites differ in their gene expression profiles with classical or mesenchymal signatures associated with clinically distinct molecular subtypes of {GBM} found within the same tumor. The results also showed significant differences in the expression of genes specific for targeted therapeutics. Our investigations have enabled the identification of four novel fusion transcripts—

We found no differences between untreated and recurrent stages in the expression levels of genes involved in fusion transcripts, suggesting the lack of association between fusion transcript and treatment response. In contrast, longitudinal changes in the expression of
              {VEGF}
              and
              {MGMT}
              genes were concordant with the tumor response to bevacizumab and temozolomide. Our study underscores the importance of integrating a multisampling approach and {RNA} sequencing and demonstrates the predictive merit of an integrated approach for differentiating genomic aberrations associated with untreated or post-treatment recurrent {GBMs}.},
